# Description
This is a 3D - TicTacToe played between the human user and AI. This is built on the basis of a magic cube such that is the marking of the player gets to the sum of 42 it will be considered a strike. This has been created in **C++**.

## A. Rules

### <ins>Winning Strategy:</ins>
A winning line is formed when the sum of the three numbers is 42 on the magic square, and the
three points are collinear i.e each row, column, pillar, four main space diagonals.<br />
*Hint: One of the working solutions would be to test if the three points in 3-D space have the sum
as 42 and the three points are collinear.*
